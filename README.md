## Lee Lemmatizer
### A Python-based fully automatic lemmatization tool

The Princeton WordNet? Lemmatizer requires the part of speech (POS) of each word, however, it is unlikely for a machine to have this value during the automatic processing. Lee Lemmatizer makes it possible by automatically providing the lemmatizer the most possible POS. The key for this project is to find the most possible lemma, not the lemma with given POS.

The source code is also available at https://code.google.com/p/lee-lemmatizer/.
